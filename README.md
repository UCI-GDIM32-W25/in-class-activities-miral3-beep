### Activity 2
I built the scene and coded lines under the Start() and Update() methods. I wrote get component for the 2D Rigidbody on the penguin. I also wrote the Input.GetKeyDown, so the penguin will move up when space is pressed. Then I got Library errors so I am unable to push anything to Github.
