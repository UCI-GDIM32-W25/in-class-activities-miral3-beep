### Activity 2
I built the scene and coded lines under the Start() and Update() methods. I wrote get component for the 2D Rigidbody on the penguin. I also wrote the Input.GetKeyDown, so the penguin will move up when space is pressed. Then I got Library errors so I am unable to push anything to Github.

### Activity 1 
The locator script disappears under the Locator objects and only appears in one. This is because we wrote it to check the instances and destroy the extra ones so only one remains. 
### Activity 2

### Activity 3
I created the project and downloaded the free bird and pipe assets. https://github.com/UCI-GDIM32-W25/HW4/compare/main...miral3-beep:HW4:main 

## Week 5
### Activity 1 
I think the design of these interfaces and abstract classes fit the design of the project, the interface for breakable objects is used by the objects that are breakable, while the Elven Sword doesn't reference this class, indicating that it can't be broken. I would keep it the same because you can also define durability in each item and change it instead of being inheritable. If I was building a project with weapons with varying durabilities of each object, I would probably follow the same model. 
### Activity 2 
ItemW5Demo2 Controller, Player model class, Enemy stats is the view. 
### Activity 3 
Scenario 1: prefabs with scriptable object, sprites, data could be type of note it is, where in the song the beat has to be hit. 
Scenario 2: Finite State Machine, Inheiritance, Scriptable Objects Finite State Machine - players need to know when someone on the other team or their is down, Ui displays, score updates. Inheritance - each weapon has a animation and damage, parent class for each agent, different animations and health. Scriptable objects - for inventory. Model View Controller - stats of abilities is the model, character causingb damage to other characters would be the controller, the UI for activating abilities. 
Scenario 3: States would be useful for the plants and the players, growth state, players finding the plants.
### Activity 4

## Week 6 
### Activity 1
Performance- Don't use mesh colliders and polygon colliders as the faces can get complicated and then you would have to calculate where it collide vs. using a box or a circle , avoid too many debug logs, using GetComponent(), and always test web builds.
#
Gizmos- using gizmos to visualize the collider, bc its own component, it can be used for other objects with a circle collider, they are only visible in the scene, the red arrow can also visualize how fast an object is moving along with direction. 
### Activity 2 
Mira Liu, Luis Chavarin
